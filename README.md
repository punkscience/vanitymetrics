Global Game Jam 2016 -- with Orpheus, Punk Science and Friends

Mournful Horn was built in 48 hours as part of the 2016 Global Game Jam, based on the theme "Ritual" by Vanity Metrics out of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.
Your army has won the day, but now the dead must be honoured. Stand upon the craggy bluffs of your homeland and rain flaming arrows down upon the funeral ships below.
But be forewarned! Those warriors not granted their rite by fire will fester and erupt in necromantic fury, seeking the one who has wronged them. (Hint: It's you.)
